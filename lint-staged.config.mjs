 * Runs on staged files only (fast). ESLint 9+/10 resolves the config file per
 * linted file (it walks up to the nearest eslint.config.mjs), so running from
 * the repo root still applies each workspace's own config: node for packages,
 * nextjs for the example and the docs. `projectService: true` likewise resolves each file's nearest
 * tsconfig for type-aware rules. Prettier honours .prettierignore, so the
 * lockfile and build artifacts are skipped even if staged.
