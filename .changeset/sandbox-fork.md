`fork({ ports })` gives another view of the same sandbox, with ports of its own, so several harness sessions, each with its bridge on its own port, run side by side in one sandbox. A view starts its own processes and registers its own credentials, and its `release()` only touches what is its own: releasing one session leaves the others running. `stop()` and `destroy()` still act on the whole sandbox.
